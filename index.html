        <h1>Project on console</h1>
        <p>If you want to set up a visual studio code project, follow these steps<br>Go to visual studio code and click on any button depending on which computer you have. It will automatically download for you. Then, once it is fully downloaded, go to explorer and download a Live Server right here on this app. After, go to your desktop and make a folder. Come back to this app and open the folder. Finally, add some files, for example, index.html,style.css, main.js and so on.</p>
        <p2>A console screen is where you can input things and the output comes on your app or website depending what you are making. For example: variables. When we add a variable inside a console.log, it prints the number or letters you picked, into the website, webpage, or app you are making!
